Anubhav loves building software, mixing stacks and making memes.

Starting his journey at the early age of 15, when he built from scratch a social network and a search engine, Anubhav has over a decade of experience in dealing with the complexities of large scale software. Since then he has been a regular freelancer - “only taking up projects which others have given up on over their difficulty” (in his own words) and contributor to several open-source projects.

He has authored two books titled “Hands-on Python Deep Learning for Web” and “Mobile Deep Learning with TensorFlow Lite, ML Kit and Flutter”. He has been recognized as a Venkat Panchpakesan Memorial Scholar for displaying his determination towards the growth of computer science against adversities faced in life. He has also been recognized as an Intel Software Innovator for his contributions to the Intel early innovation ecosystem.

Anubhav has had the experience of working as a Full Stack Developer and Machine Learning before embarking on a full-time entrepreneurial journey with Dynopii. He has previously led open-source organizations and developer communities. You will often find him talking about the Web, Machine Learning and the general philosophy of life.

And he makes nice memes.
